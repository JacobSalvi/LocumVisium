## Installation
This application is designed for Android devices targeting API level 31 (Android 12).

### Set Google Maps API Key
To integrate Google Maps, you need to provide your API key. Update the `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in the `app/manifests` directory by adding your API key as shown below:

```xml
<meta-data
   android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
   android:value="${apiKey}"
/>
```

Replace `${apiKey}` with your actual Google Maps API key.

### Configure Server IP Address
Ensure the application points to the correct server. For local installations or when using a local server, set the server IP address in the `config.properties` file located at `app/src/main/res/raw/`. Update the file as follows:

```properties
host=SERVER_IP
```

Replace `SERVER_IP` with the actual IP address of your server.
